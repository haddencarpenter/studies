    whatWorked: [
      {
        point: "Question Design Covers the Full Stack",
        detail: "The 9 questions test fundamentally different capabilities: real-time data retrieval (Q1, Q4), tactical planning (Q2, Q5), systemic thinking (Q3, Q6), quantitative rigor (Q7, Q8), and signal distillation (Q9). This is better than most AI benchmarks that test a single dimension."
      },
      {
        point: "Anti-Bias Rule is Credible",
        detail: "The explicit instruction to 'score competitors fairly even if they outperform Shumi' — and the fact that Shumi wasn't even tested in this round — adds credibility. Most vendor benchmarks wouldn't leave their own product out."
      },
      {
        point: "Weighted Scoring Reflects Real Trader Needs",
        detail: "Actionability (25%) and Accuracy (25%) getting the highest weights is correct. A beautiful analysis that's factually wrong or can't be traded is worthless. The 50% combined weight on these two dimensions is a defensible design choice."
      }
    ],

    whatNeedsWork: [
      {
        severity: "critical",
        point: "Single Evaluator Bias",
        detail: "All 270 scores were assigned by one evaluator (the AI conducting the study). This is the single biggest methodological flaw. Best practice: minimum 3 independent raters with inter-rater reliability measured (Krippendorff's alpha ≥ 0.67). Without this, the scores reflect one perspective, not ground truth.",
        fix: "Use 3+ human domain experts. Compute inter-rater agreement. Publish disagreements."

        severity: "critical",

        detail: "Accuracy scored 25% of the total, but no systematic fact-checking was performed. Example: DeepSeek claimed '100% historical win rate' for its power-law strategy — this received Accuracy: 5, but should have been cross-verified against actual BTC price history. Grok's backtest numbers (31.2% WR) were accepted at face value.",

        detail: "Responses were collected over multiple sessions (not all in the same hour). Market conditions change. A platform queried at 9am may give different answers than one queried at 9pm. This is especially problematic for Q4 (funding rates) and Q5 (48h plan) where real-time data matters.",

      },
      {
        severity: "high",

        detail: "The evaluator knew which platform produced each response during scoring. This introduces unconscious anchoring — if Grok's Q1 was excellent, the evaluator may subconsciously give Grok's Q2 a boost. Halo effects are well-documented in evaluation research.",

        fix: "Submit each question 3 times per platform. Report mean and standard deviation. This reveals which platforms are consistent vs. lucky."
      },
      {
        severity: "medium",
        point: "Missing Forward-Test Validation",
        detail: "The study evaluates quality of analysis but never checks if the predictions were correct. Did BTC actually follow the paths described? Did the 48h plans produce profitable signals? This is the ultimate test of a trading analyst.",
        fix: "Record all specific predictions with timestamps. Check outcomes 7/30/90 days later. Publish a 'prediction accuracy' leaderboard alongside the quality scores."
      },
      {
        severity: "low",
        point: "Sample Size is Small",
        detail: "9 questions × 6 platforms = 54 data points. Statistical significance is limited. The difference between Grok (8.67) and Gemini (8.28) could easily be within noise.",
        fix: "Add more questions (20+), more asset classes, more market conditions (bull/bear/range). Report confidence intervals."
      }
    ],

    bestPracticesForBenchmarks: [
      "Blind evaluation: Strip all platform identifiers before scoring",
      "Multiple raters: Minimum 3 independent evaluators with published agreement metrics",
      "Temporal control: All submissions within the same market session",
      "Repeated sampling: 3+ submissions per question to measure variance",
      "Ground truth: Fact-check all specific claims against independent data",
      "Forward testing: Track predictions and report accuracy after the fact",
      "Tier parity: Compare equivalent product tiers across platforms",
      "Open data: Publish raw responses so others can re-score independently",
      "Confidence intervals: Report statistical uncertainty alongside point estimates",
      "Adversarial questions: Include questions with known correct answers to calibrate scoring"
    ],

    finalVerdict: "This study produces a useful directional ranking — the tier structure (Grok/Gemini >> DeepSeek/ChatGPT >> Perplexity/ChainGPT) is likely robust even under different methodology. But the specific scores should be treated as estimates with wide error bars, not as precise measurements. The biggest value isn't the rankings — it's the qualitative insight into what each platform does well and poorly, which is harder to fake with methodology."
